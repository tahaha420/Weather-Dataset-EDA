# Weather-Dataset-EDA
In this project, I poked around a comprehensive weather dataset to uncover patterns and trends in temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
The purpose of this project is to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA) .

## Goals of the Project:

1. Explore a weather dataset with Pandas.
2. Identify correlations.
3. Visualize the dataset.


  
## Materials and methods: 
The data that we are going to use for this is found on Kaggle.
The dataset contains weather data recorded at specific time intervals. It includes columns such as 'Formatted Date', 'Temperature (C)', 'Apparent Temperature (C)', 'Humidity', 'Wind Speed (km/h)', 'Visibility (km)', and 'Pressure (millibars)', capturing various meteorological measurements. 
Location of the weather is Leeds, England


## Used Libraries:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
